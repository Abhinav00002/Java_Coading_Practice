Problem: Given a string of words, find the minimum distance (in terms of word positions) between two given target words.

âœ… Key Concepts

Linear scan of the word array
Tracking indices of the last seen positions of each target word
Constant extra space

ðŸ§  Explanation

Split the string by whitespace into a list/array of words.
Iterate over word positions; when you encounter one of the two target words, record its index.
Anytime both indices are valid, compute the difference and update the minimum distance.
